# KinectChangeDetection
      Kinect Change Detection Project I have created and written C++ programs using the point clouds library to obtain, compare, and display point clouds. I am currently using the ICP algorithm to compare two different point clouds. The program uses ICP to compare two different point clouds, and creates a window displaying the input point cloud overlaid with the output point cloud.
